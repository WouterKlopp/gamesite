        <p><b> Making of by Wouter Klopping - 102864 - 3GA-4DP </b></p>
        
 <p><b> Initial Concept </b></p>
<p>For the subject Entrepreneurship, we had to make a business plan for a game of our own design. We chose a game concept I came up with where a group of NPC's were aware that they are in the game world. This game world is corrupted and it was up to the player to figure out how to get them back in "real life" before the game becomes fully corrupted and is unplayable. I thought it would be a good idea to use this concept as a game for the website of CT1. The concept for the website, I thought, should be cosmic (hence the stars in the background). The reason I chose for "cosmic" is because it is one of the huge elements of the game story that will play out later in the game. Think HP Lovecraft. If I would have time, I would also add some graphical "glitches" on different part of the website, but I am sadly out of time for that.  </p>

 <p><b> My work process </b></p>
 
 <p> I was able to create the site of Artifact in about 12 hours. I did this all in one day. I was able to do all this thanks to really taking the time in involving myself with the homework assignment. Ive learned everything in there that I then applied to the Artifact website.
 
 I also was able to get help from a very good friend of mine. He directed me in the direction of some great resources that I used often. The following were one of those links: </p>
 
 <div> http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp </div>
 <div> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/ </div>
 <div> http://lea.verou.me/projects/ </div>
 
 <p>With all this in check, I started to get to work. I know my concept, copy pasted the whole homework code and css and made a quick draft of how I wanted to website to look (see mockup picture). I soon realised that I did not like the Aside bar, and removed it. From there I chose to increase the article space so that it would look more like a blogging site where updates could be held. After that, I started fiddling with the design. I wanted the master template file to look as finished as possible in regards to design and cleanliness so that I could make the rest of the page from there on out. Once that was done I went back and forth between my homework code and the Artifact site. Added what was necessairy and adjusted it to the needs of the website. Now everything was at it's place. The home page, game info page, media page, leaderboard, contact form and finally the making of page. I then checked my code three times, to make sure there was no useless code left and uploaded it to amazon. </p>
