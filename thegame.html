     <p> Artifact

<p>Genre: Horror, RPG </p>

<p>Visual theme: SNES sprite</p>

<p> Platofrm: PC and 3DS </p>

<p> Release date: Q4 2013 </p>

<p> The story </p>


<p>In Artifact, the game characters are aware that they exist in a gameworld. They do not know how they got there in the first place. They used to be normal people like you and me, yet somehow they are now stuck in this game world. They ask the player to help them to play the game and help them get out somehow.</p>

<p>But meanwhile, the game itself is slowly corrupting. Corrupting effects like artifacts that get in the way of gameplay, corrupting effects that slowly alter the level of sanity of the in-game characters.
It is up to the player to help them and find out what is happening to the game and why it is corrupting everything.
But remember, can you trust these game characters that are slowly being corrupted by the core of the game? What will happen when you actually finish it? </p>

<p>The worlf of Artifact is slowly corrupting and it is up to the player to solve the reason behind the corruption of the game itself while saving ingame characters that claim to come from the same world as the player. The corrupting effects will need to be removed by the player in order to progress in the game. These specific game errors will give puzzle elements that defy logic and will give the player new ways of thinking about these revolutionary puzzles.</p>

<p>Artifact will be able to be played both online and offline. Through Steam the player can cooperate with other players and help each other in solving puzzles.</p>
